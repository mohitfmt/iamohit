## Why Upgrade?

Next.js 14 promised significant improvements:
- **Turbopack** for faster builds
- **Server Actions** for simpler data mutations
- **Improved App Router** with better streaming
- **Better Image Optimization** with AVIF support

For a platform serving 8.5M monthly users, these improvements were too good to ignore.

## The Breaking Changes (What Actually Broke)

### 1. Metadata API Changes

**Before (Pages Router):**
```javascript
// pages/blog/[slug].js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      metadata: { title: '...' }
    }
  }
}
```

**After (App Router):**
```javascript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.js
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  return {
    title: '...',
    description: '...'
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Had to refactor 200+ pages. Took 2 weeks.

### 2. Loading States

App Router's `loading.js` is powerful but different.

**Before:** Manual loading states everywhere
**After:** File-based loading UI

```javascript
// app/blog/loading.js
export default function Loading() {
  return <SkeletonLoader />
}
```

**Result:** 60% less boilerplate code. Worth it.

### 3. Layouts and Templates

New nested layouts are amazing but required architectural rethinking.

**Before:** Single `_app.js` with conditional rendering
**After:** Nested `layout.js` files

Benefits:
- Persistent layout state
- Partial re-renders
- Better code organization

## Performance Improvements

### Build Time
- **Before:** 8 minutes (CI/CD)
- **After:** 3 minutes with Turbopack
- **Savings:** 5 minutes per deploy × 10 deploys/day = 50 minutes/day

### Runtime Performance
- **Streaming SSR:** Faster TTFB (Time to First Byte)
- **Improved Caching:** Better cache hit rates
- **Server Components:** Reduced client bundle by 40%

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Development (Week 1-2)
Created `/app-new` directory. Built side-by-side with existing pages.

### Phase 2: Route-by-Route Migration (Week 3-6)
1. Homepage → Test → Deploy
2. Blog listing → Test → Deploy
3. Individual posts → Test → Deploy
4. Projects → Test → Deploy

Incremental approach minimized risk.

### Phase 3: Full Cutover (Week 7)
- Deleted `/pages` directory
- Renamed `/app-new` to `/app`
- Updated all internal links
- Comprehensive testing

## What Surprised Us

### 1. Middleware Changes
Middleware API changed significantly. Had to rewrite authentication logic.

### 2. Dynamic Imports
Some dynamic imports broke. Had to add `'use client'` directives strategically.

### 3. CSS Modules
CSS Modules work slightly differently. Had to adjust some selectors.

## Lessons Learned

### Start with TypeScript
TypeScript caught 70% of issues during migration. Without it, we'd still be debugging.

### Use Feature Flags
Feature flags let us toggle between old/new routes. Critical for safe rollout.

### Test Everything
Edge cases broke in unexpected ways. Comprehensive testing is non-negotiable.

## Key Takeaways

- **App Router is worth it** for new projects
- **Migration takes time** - budget 6-8 weeks for large apps
- **Server Components are game-changers** for performance
- **Turbopack delivers** on build time promises
- **Plan for breaking changes** in middleware and metadata
