## 2006: The Beginning

I started with **Visual Basic 6.0**. Desktop applications. Databases stored locally. No cloud. No Stack Overflow (it launched in 2008).

When code broke, you were on your own. Documentation? MSDN CDs. Forums? Slow and sparse.

**First project:** Inventory management system for local business. VB6 + MS Access. 

**It worked.** That feeling never gets old.

## 2010: The PHP Revolution

Joined Kgraph - learned PHP, MySQL, jQuery. The web was exploding.

**Key shift:** From desktop to web. Applications living in browsers. Users accessing from anywhere.

**Challenge:** Browser compatibility. IE6 nightmares. CSS hacks everywhere.

**Lesson learned:** The platform matters less than solving real problems.

## 2015: JavaScript Everywhere

Node.js changed everything. JavaScript on the server? Revolutionary.

Joined Accenture. Enterprise projects. Fortune 100 clients. Teams of 50+ developers.

**Tech stack:** C#, .NET, Angular, WPF
**Scale:** Billion-dollar budgets, million-user platforms
**Reality check:** More meetings than code

**Key insight:** At scale, communication matters more than code quality.

## 2019: The React Era

Went solo. Full-stack consulting. React + Node.js became my bread and butter.

**Projects:**
- Three.js virtual worlds
- Web3 experiments  
- E-commerce platforms
- Marketing automation tools

**Freedom:** Build what you want, how you want
**Tradeoff:** No team, no stability, constant hustle

**Lesson:** Impact at scale requires more than just code.

## 2021-2025: The FMT Chapter

Found my sweet spot: **Next.js + News Media + Scale**

**The problem:** WordPress struggling with 3M users
**The solution:** Next.js migration
**The result:** 8.5M users, 184% growth, 60% faster

**What changed:** Finally combined technical skills with business impact

**What I learned:** 
- Performance optimization is a business strategy
- Scalability decisions affect revenue
- Infrastructure costs directly impact profitability

## What's Changed

### Technology
- **2006:** Desktop apps, local databases
- **2025:** Cloud-native, serverless, edge computing

### Development Process
- **2006:** Waterfall, 18-month release cycles
- **2025:** Agile, CI/CD, deploy 10x/day

### Learning Resources
- **2006:** Books, MSDN CDs, slow forums
- **2025:** Stack Overflow, YouTube, AI assistants

### Collaboration
- **2006:** Same office, same timezone
- **2025:** Distributed teams, async communication

### Performance Expectations
- **2006:** "Load in under 10 seconds"
- **2025:** "2 seconds or users leave"

## What Hasn't Changed

### 1. Good Code Principles
Clean code, proper naming, separation of concerns - still matter.

DRY, SOLID, KISS - these aren't trends, they're fundamentals.

### 2. Understanding the Problem
Before writing code, understand **why** you're solving this problem.

90% of projects fail not from bad code, but from solving the wrong problem.

### 3. User Focus
Whether 2006 desktop app or 2025 web app: **users don't care about your tech stack.**

They care if it works, if it's fast, if it solves their problem.

### 4. Continuous Learning
- **2006:** Learning VB6
- **2010:** Learning PHP
- **2015:** Learning React
- **2020:** Learning Next.js
- **2025:** Learning... (never stops)

The moment you stop learning, you become obsolete.

### 5. Problem-Solving Mindset
Technology changes. Languages come and go. Frameworks rise and fall.

**What persists:** The ability to break down complex problems into simple solutions.

## What I Wish I Knew Earlier

### 1. Communication > Code Quality
At scale, explaining your solution matters more than how elegant it is.

### 2. Business Impact > Technical Perfection
Ship working code that generates revenue > Perfect code that never ships

### 3. Choose Your Battles
Not every technical debt needs fixing. Not every pattern needs refactoring.

### 4. Team > Solo Superhero
Years 2018-2021: Solo consultant. Impressive projects, exhausting lifestyle.
Years 2021-2025: Team at FMT. More impact, less burnout.

### 5. Specialize, But Stay Versatile
Deep expertise in one area (Next.js) + broad knowledge across stack = Career longevity

## Looking Ahead: 2025-2030

**What's coming:**
- AI-assisted development (already here)
- Edge computing everywhere
- WebAssembly going mainstream
- Continued JavaScript dominance

**What I'm focusing on:**
- Deepening Next.js expertise
- Performance optimization mastery
- Scale architecture patterns
- Leadership skills

**What won't change:**
- Need to solve real problems
- Focus on user value
- Continuous learning
- Clear communication

## Final Thoughts

After 18 years, the biggest lesson: **Technology is just a tool.**

What matters:
- Problems you solve
- Value you create
- People you help
- Impact you make

The rest is just syntax.
