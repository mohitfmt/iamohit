## The Challenge

When I joined Free Malaysia Today (FMT) in 2021, the platform was drowning. **5.2-second load times**. Traffic growing 15% monthly. Users complaining about slow pages. Ad revenue suffering from poor performance.

The existing WordPress setup couldn't handle the scale. Database at 100% load during traffic spikes. Sections of the site literally disappearing when users needed them most.

Something had to change. **Fast.**

## The Decision: Why Next.js 14.1?

After evaluating multiple options, Next.js emerged as the clear winner:

### Server-Side Rendering + Static Generation
- News articles perfect for ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Pages regenerate on-demand with 60-second revalidation
- Instant loads for users, fresh content for breaking news

### Built-in Image Optimization
- Automatic WebP/AVIF conversion
- Lazy loading out of the box
- Reduced bandwidth by 70%

### Edge-Ready Architecture
- CloudFlare CDN integration
- Edge caching for global audience
- Sub-second response times worldwide

## The Migration Strategy

**Zero downtime was non-negotiable.** We had 100K+ articles, millions of monthly visitors, and critical ad revenue at stake.

### Phase 1: Parallel Build (Months 1-2)

```javascript
// next.config.js
const config = {
  images: {
    domains: ['cdn.freemalaysiatoday.com'],
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  },
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
  },
}
```

Built the entire Next.js platform alongside existing WordPress. Same content, better architecture.

### Phase 2: Shadow Testing (Month 3)
- Internal team testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Load testing with simulated traffic
- Bug fixes and optimization

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Month 4)
- 10% traffic redirect → Monitor
- 50% traffic redirect → Validate
- 100% cutover → Celebrate

## The Results

**Traffic Growth:**
- 3M → 8.5M monthly users (**+184%**)
- 850K → 2.1M pages per day
- 6K Google News subscribers (from zero)

**Performance Improvements:**
- 5.2s → 1.3s load time (**-75%**)
- All Core Web Vitals: Green
- 100/100 Lighthouse scores

**Business Impact:**
- Infrastructure cost: RM 60K → RM 15K/month
- Ad revenue: +40% from better performance
- User engagement: +60% time on site

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. ISR > SSR for News Content
Initially, we used full SSR (Server-Side Rendering). CPU usage was insane during traffic spikes.

**Solution:** Switched to ISR with 60-second revalidation. Pages cached at edge, regenerated only when needed.

### 2. Database Read Replicas Are Essential
Single CloudSQL instance couldn't handle read load.

**Solution:** 3 read replicas across regions. Write to master, read from replicas. Query response time: 800ms → 120ms.

### 3. Aggressive Caching Everywhere
- CloudFlare: 5-minute cache for articles
- Redis: API response caching
- Browser: Aggressive static asset caching

Result: 90% of requests never hit our servers.

## What I'd Do Differently

### Start with TypeScript
We used JavaScript initially. Added TypeScript later. Should have started with it. Type safety would have prevented 40% of our production bugs.

### Better Monitoring from Day 1
Added Prometheus + Grafana in Month 6. Should have been Month 1. Can't optimize what you can't measure.

### More Aggressive Image Optimization
We optimized images manually. Should have used automated pipeline from start. Would have saved weeks of work.

## Key Takeaways

- **Next.js scales beautifully** for content platforms
- **ISR is perfect for news** (fresh content + performance)
- **Zero downtime migrations are possible** with proper planning
- **Measure everything** before and after
- **Edge caching is non-negotiable** for global audience
