There’s a moment in every platform’s life when the dashboard starts whispering things the boardroom can’t hear yet.

For Free Malaysia Today (FMT), that whisper started in **Feb–Mar 2023**: traffic getting sticky in the wrong places, pages slow to breathe, a codebase that had more plot twists than a soap opera. A search for a fixer had been running for a year.

**October 2023:** they found me.
**November 2023:** I joined.
**March 6, 2024:** I shipped **V3**.

And then—eight months later—I tore it down and rebuilt it **again**.

Not because people were complaining. Because they weren’t.

Because “works” isn’t the same as “right.”

## The Inheritance (V2): When “Pages Router” Means “Pages Roulette”

Let’s name it: **V2**. Technically “Pages Router,” practically “mystery novel.” Architecture without a map, patterns without pattern. It served content, yes—but fixing it would’ve taken longer than rebuilding.

So I did what any choosy engineer with a ticking clock does: **kept the vendor on life support** to keep V2 standing while I rebuilt **V3** from scratch.

**Why not just tidy V2?** Because sometimes the fastest path forward is past the rubble, not through it.

---

## V3 (Mar 6, 2024): The App Router Bet

I went all-in on the buzz: **Next.js App Router**. It promised modern patterns and pretty performance graphs. For a while, we got them.

- The site **picked up**.
- Editors were **happier**.
- Users felt the **speed**.

Eight to nine months in, the whisper came back.

### The Problems You Only See If You Stare at Logs

App Router’s SPA-style navigation is fantastic for apps. For news? It quietly rearranges your furniture.

1. **Ad targeting drifted.**
   User jumps from Business → Lifestyle. The page shell stays; the **ad params don’t refresh**. Wrong ads, real money.

2. **SEO metadata went stale mid-session.**
   Title, description, JSON-LD, keywords—**not reliably refreshed** on client transitions. Crawlers get yesterday’s label on today’s jar.

3. **Analytics didn’t tell the truth.**
   Pageviews/time-on-page depend on **real navigations**. SPA transitions blur counting. Editorial decisions drift.

4. **CDN friction.**
   The App Router + **Cloudflare “Cache Everything”** dance kept stepping on toes. Invalidation got fussy.

None of this sets off alarms on Day 1. On Day 240, it becomes your future.

So I did the unpopular thing: I rebuilt **again**—this time to what actually fits a **news platform**.

## V4 (April 2025): Pages Router + ISR, Done Like You Mean It

> Tools don’t win. Fit does.

I moved FMT to **Next.js Pages Router + ISR**—not because “Pages is better,” but because **news needs fully refreshed pages**:

- **True navigations** → ad params reset correctly
- **Server-rendered metadata** → search engines index what readers see
- **Reliable analytics** → editors get reality, not vibes
- **Clean CDN edges** → Cloudflare behaves like a performance team, not a referee

And then I solved the unglamorous parts—the ones that actually move graphs.

### 1) Invalidate Cache Like a Surgeon, Not a Meteor

Most teams still reach for `cache.clear()`. That’s not invalidation; it’s arson.

We built **dependency-aware** invalidation with an **LRU cache**—no Redis, no ceremony:

```javascript
// When caching a category page, embed its dependencies
cache.set(`category/business`, {
  data,
  deps: ["post:12345", "post:12346", "post:12347"],
});

// On content change, invalidate only dependents
function onContentChange(id) {
  cache.invalidateWhere((entry) => entry.deps.includes(`post:${id}`));
}
```

**Result:** updates land fast without stampeding origin or flushing the universe.

### 2) ISR That Respects Reality

Static where it’s safe, fresh where it matters:

```javascript
// pages/article/[slug].js
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const article = await fetchArticle(params.slug);
  return {
    props: { article },
    revalidate: 60, // refresh on demand after a minute
  };
}
```

- **Server HTML** for crawlers and ad stacks
- **Predictable freshness** for editors
- **No SPA illusions** for analytics

### 3) Real-Time, But Prioritized (Because Not All Updates Are Noble)

WebSub (PubSubHubbub) pipes content events into **priority queues**:

```javascript
const PRIORITY = {
  CRITICAL: { concurrency: 10 }, // Homepage
  HIGH: { concurrency: 5 }, // Sections
  MEDIUM: { concurrency: 20 }, // Articles
  LOW: { concurrency: 3 }, // Archives
};
```

The homepage shouldn’t wait politely behind a 2019 archive tweak.

### 4) Cloudflare: Cache HTML, Purge Precisely

We went all-edge:

- **Cache HTML** (not just assets)
- **Purge by URL/tag**, not “purge everything”
- Let the edge do the heavy lifting; let origin breathe

This is where the cost line starts behaving.

### 5) Database: Boring Moves That Overperform

- Prune ancient **revisions** (keep a few first + last; drop the noise)
- Add **indexes** for what you actually query
- Move 80% reads to **replicas**; keep writes single and safe

You don’t need a new data religion. You need good housekeeping.

## What Changed (V2 → V4)

Let’s talk outcomes, not adjectives.

- **Monthly users:** **3M → 8.5M** (**+184%**)
- **Avg. load time:** **5.2s → 1.3s** (−75%)
- **Organic share:** **40% → 68%**
- **Recirculation:** **1% → 23%** (users stopped bouncing and started browsing)
- **Cloud spend:** **$45–60K → $12–15K** (v4 is where the drop happens; **v3 was still pricey**)
- **Uptime across migrations:** **99.9%**
- **Content at scale:** 200+ articles/day; updates in **<2 minutes**; viral bursts to **14k+ concurrent** without drama

The headline isn’t “we used X.”
It’s “we matched the job to the tool and trimmed everything that didn’t help.”

---

## “But Wasn’t V2 Also Pages Router?”

Yes. **V2 used the same tool I chose for V4.**
The difference is the gap between “has a piano” and “plays it.”

- V2: Pages Router **without** architecture
- V4: Pages Router **with** ISR, dependency-aware caching, real-time priorities, and a CDN strategy that behaves

**Same label, different craft.**

## The Steal-This Part: What Actually Works for News Sites

If you only copy five things, copy these:

1. **Choose the framework for the behavior you need.**

   - News/content: **Pages Router + ISR** (server HTML, true navigations)
   - App-like dashboards: **App Router** (SPAs shine there)

2. **Never nuke caches.**
   Track dependencies; invalidate surgically. Your origin will thank you.

3. **Prioritize freshness by audience impact.**
   Homepage/sections first, then the long tail.

4. **Cache HTML at the edge.**
   Purge URLs/tags, not the universe. Let Cloudflare earn its keep.

5. **Do the boring database work early.**
   Prune revisions, add the obvious indexes, read-replicate. It’s 80/20 that feels like magic.

---

## Two Rebuilds, Zero Drama

Could I have coasted on V3? Absolutely. Everyone was happy.

But future problems rarely arrive with a siren. They arrive as small mismatches—ad params that don’t refresh, meta tags that lie to crawlers, analytics that quietly drift. If you ship for a living, you hear them early.

So I rebuilt again—not loudly, not to make a point—just to make the platform **right**.

---

## The Minimal Code That Paid Rent

A few tiny patterns did a lot of work.

**Dependency-aware invalidation**

```javascript
function dependsOn(entry, id) {
  return entry.deps?.includes(id);
}

export function invalidateBy(ids = []) {
  for (const key of cache.keys()) {
    const entry = cache.get(key);
    if (ids.some((id) => dependsOn(entry, id))) cache.delete(key);
  }
}
```

**ISR with clear expectations**

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const article = await fetchArticle(params.slug);
  return { props: { article }, revalidate: 60 };
}
```

**Priority queues (shape, not ceremony)**

```javascript
queue.add({ kind: "homepage", id }, { priority: "CRITICAL" });
queue.add({ kind: "section", id }, { priority: "HIGH" });
queue.add({ kind: "post", id }, { priority: "MEDIUM" });
```

Small pieces. Big leverage.

---

## What This Proves (Quietly)

- **Fit beats fashion.** App Router is brilliant—for apps. We’re a news site.
- **Operational taste matters.** Knowing when “fast enough” isn’t honest.
- **Craft compounds.** CDN, ISR, caching, indexes—each is modest; together they’re a new curve.

If you want fanfare, ship a redesign.
If you want results, ship foundations.

---

## Footnotes for the Curious

- **Pages Router deployment:** **April 2025** (V4)
- **App Router run:** ~8–9 months (V3)
- **Ad/SEO/analytics drift:** all traced to SPA-style transitions
- **Cache:** custom **LRU** (no Redis)
- **Edge:** Cloudflare “Cache Everything,” purge by tag/URL
- **Content scale:** hundreds of thousands of items; **100K+** migrated through the new path with zero data loss

If you’re wrestling with a high-traffic news or content platform and the graphs won’t listen, I’m happy to compare notes on what’s signal and what’s noise. The playbook above is open book—and battle-tested.
