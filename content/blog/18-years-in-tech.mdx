## Gwalior, 2000: The 64% That Changed Everything

It's 2000. I'm sitting in my room in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, holding my 12th board exam results. **64%.**

My parents wanted me to study business administration. Everyone expected me to score less than 50%. But I had other plans. I wanted computers.

That 64% wasn't just a grade—it was proof that I'm built for solving hard problems, not following easy paths.

**Twenty-five years later, I'm writing this from Kuala Lumpur, where I scaled a news platform from 3M to 8.5M monthly users (+184% growth), became a Top 3% StackOverflow contributor, and survived every major technology shift from Visual Basic 6.0 to Kubernetes.**

This is that story.

## Phase 1: Desktop Era (2006-2010) — Learning to Build Things

### Visual Basic 6.0: Where It All Started

My first professional project wasn't glamorous. It was a desktop application built in Visual Basic 6.0 for VNS Microsystems.

**What I learned:**

- How to translate business requirements into working software
- The satisfaction of watching users actually use what you built
- That code quality matters more than clever tricks

**First major lesson:** Users don't care about your technology choices. They care if it solves their problem.

### The .NET Transition

Around 2008, the industry moved to .NET Framework. I moved with it.

**Key decision:** Learn fundamentals, not just frameworks.

While everyone was memorizing APIs, I focused on:

- Object-oriented principles
- Database design (SQL Server)
- Understanding the compilation process
- How memory management actually works

**Result:** When .NET 2.0 → 3.5 → 4.0 happened, I adapted faster than most. Frameworks change. Fundamentals don't.

---

## Phase 2: Web 2.0 Era (2010-2018) — The PHP/MySQL Years

### The WordPress Goldmine

Around 2012, I discovered WordPress development. It was booming in India.

**Projects I built:**

- Corporate websites for local businesses
- E-commerce stores with WooCommerce
- Custom plugins for specific client needs
- Theme customizations

**What this phase taught me:**

- **Performance matters.** A slow site loses customers.
- **Security is non-negotiable.** I learned this the hard way after a client site got hacked.
- **User experience beats technical perfection.** A fast, ugly site beats a slow, beautiful one.

### jQuery: The JavaScript Awakening

Before React, there was jQuery. And honestly? It was magical.

```javascript
// This felt like superpowers in 2013
$(".button").click(function () {
  $(".modal").fadeIn();
});
```

**Critical realization:** JavaScript wasn't just for form validation anymore. It was becoming the future of web development.

### The AJAX Revolution

When I built my first single-page application using jQuery + AJAX in 2014, it felt revolutionary.

**Problem I solved:** A client wanted a product catalog that updated without page refreshes.

**Solution:** AJAX calls to PHP backend, dynamic DOM manipulation.

**User feedback:** "This feels like magic!"

**My internal thought:** "If they think this is magic, wait until they see what's coming next..."

---

## Phase 3: Modern Cloud Era (2018-2025) — Everything Changes

### React: The Paradigm Shift

2018 was my year of unlearning.

**Old mindset (jQuery):** Manipulate the DOM directly.  
**New mindset (React):** Describe what you want, let React figure out the DOM.

**First impression:** "This is unnecessarily complex."  
**After 6 months:** "I can never go back."

### Node.js: JavaScript Everywhere

Learning Node.js felt like unlocking a new superpower.

**Suddenly I could:**

- Build APIs in JavaScript
- Use the same language for frontend and backend
- Share code between client and server
- Process data asynchronously at scale

**First major Node.js project:** A real-time analytics dashboard for an e-commerce client.

**Challenge:** 50,000+ concurrent connections.  
**Solution:** WebSockets, Redis pub/sub, horizontal scaling.  
**Result:** It worked. Beautifully.

### Next.js: Where I Found My Home

2019: I discovered Next.js. It felt like React's missing pieces.

**What clicked:**

- Server-side rendering out of the box
- File-based routing (brilliant!)
- API routes (backend + frontend in one repo)
- Image optimization
- Performance by default

**Current reality:** I've built 10+ production applications with Next.js. It's my go-to for anything web-related.

---

## Phase 4: The Cloud Native Journey (2020-2025)

### Google Cloud Platform: From VPS to Cloud

**Before GCP:** Shared hosting → VPS → Dedicated servers  
**After GCP:** Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Cloud SQL, Cloud Build

**What changed:**

- Infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- Automated deployments
- Global distribution by default
- Pay for what you use

### Docker & Kubernetes: The Learning Curve

**Week 1 of Kubernetes:** "This is overcomplicated."  
**Week 4 of Kubernetes:** "Okay, I see why this exists."  
**Month 3 of Kubernetes:** "How did I live without this?"

**Real-world use case at FMT:**

- WordPress + MySQL on Kubernetes
- 1 writer replica, 3 reader replicas
- Auto-scaling during traffic spikes
- Zero downtime deployments

**Result:** Handled 260,000+ daily pageviews with 99.9% uptime.

---

## Phase 5: Web3 Exploration (2021-2023) — The Detour

### Smart Contracts & Solidity

In 2021, everyone was talking about Web3. I had to explore it.

**What I built:**

- NFT minting platforms
- Smart contracts for token transfers
- Blockchain explorers
- Integration with MetaMask

**What I learned:**

- Blockchain has legitimate use cases
- Most Web3 projects were vaporware
- The technology is fascinating
- The hype was exhausting

**Decision:** Stayed at the edges, didn't go all-in.

**Why?** My gut said: "This isn't mature enough yet. Real problems need solving now, not in Web3's eventual future."

**Current take:** Web3 has potential. But most users still need fast, reliable Web2 applications.

---

## Phase 6: News/Media Mastery (2021-Present) — Finding My Niche

### Free Malaysia Today: The 184% Growth Story

**October 2021:** Joined FMT as Technology Lead.

**The situation:**

- ~3M monthly users
- Older WordPress setup
- Limited performance optimization
- Solo operation (just me)

**The challenge:** Scale this platform while maintaining editorial workflow, integrating complex ad systems, and surviving breaking news traffic spikes.

### The Transformation Journey

**October 2024 → April 2025: The Big Migration**

**From:**

- Next.js 12 (Pages Router)
- Monolithic WordPress
- Basic caching
- Manual deployments

**To:**

- Next.js 14.1 with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Headless WordPress via GraphQL
- SmartCache system (my custom LRU cache with dependency tracking)
- Kubernetes-orchestrated infrastructure
- Cloudflare CDN with aggressive caching
- Zero downtime launch on April 18, 2025

**The Numbers:**

- **Traffic growth:** 3M → 8.5M monthly users (+184%)
- **Load time reduction:** 60% faster
- **Uptime:** 99.9%
- **Memory optimization:** 100% usage → 15% (saved the containers from crashing)
- **Cache hit rate:** 85-90%
- **Database optimization:** Query response time reduced from 800ms → 120ms

### The SmartCache Crisis & Solution

**The problem (February 2025):**

- Memory usage hitting 100%
- Containers crashing during peak traffic
- 600,000+ posts overwhelming the cache
- Stale content showing to users

**The solution I built:**

```javascript
// SmartNewsCache system with dependency tracking
// Every GraphQL query includes databaseId for surgical invalidation
// Size-based eviction (not just count)
// WebSub integration for real-time updates
```

**Result:** Memory dropped from 100% to 15%. Zero cache-related crashes since.

**What made this work:** Bias to action. I didn't wait for perfect requirements. I studied the problem, designed a solution, implemented it over a weekend, and deployed it Monday morning.

### What Watching Traffic Grow Feels Like

Here's something I've never admitted publicly: **It gives me immense pleasure when I see the traffic rise with each news story.**

**Why news/media is special:**

- You publish an article → Traffic spikes within minutes
- Breaking news → Watch real-time analytics explode
- SEO improvements → See organic search climb daily
- Performance optimization → Users stick around longer

**It's addictive.** Like watching your code compile successfully, but it happens 24/7.

## The Constants: What Hasn't Changed in 18 Years

### 1. Good Code Is Still Good Code

Whether it's Visual Basic, PHP, or TypeScript:

- **Readable > Clever**
- **Working > Perfect**
- **Maintainable > Optimized** (unless you're at scale)
- **Simple > Complex** (until simplicity breaks)

### 2. Users Don't Care About Your Stack

**Users care about:**

- Does it work?
- Is it fast?
- Does it solve my problem?

**Users don't care about:**

- Your TypeScript configuration
- Your CI/CD pipeline
- Your microservices architecture
- Your clever abstraction

### 3. Documentation Is Still Everyone's Weakness

**Truth:** Most developers (including me) hate writing documentation.

**Reality:** Future-you will hate past-you for not documenting that complex logic.

**Solution:** Write docs like you're explaining it to yourself in 6 months. Because you will be.

### 4. The Fundamentals Never Go Out of Style

After 18 years and 20+ technology shifts, here's what still matters:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures** (LRU cache saved my job in 2025)
- **Database Design** (MySQL replica strategy scaled FMT)
- **HTTP & REST** (every new framework reinvents this)
- **Git** (learned in 2010, still using it daily)
- **Problem Solving** (the meta-skill that transcends all tech)

### 5. Continuous Learning Isn't Optional

**2006:** Visual Basic 6.0  
**2010:** PHP, jQuery  
**2015:** React, Node.js  
**2020:** Kubernetes, GCP  
**2025:** Still learning (currently: Native Android, just because)

**At 40 years old, I'm learning Android development despite having zero need for it.** Why? Because learning keeps you relevant. Comfort kills careers.

## The Unexpected Lessons

### Lesson #1: Being Solo Taught Me Accountability

**4 years at FMT as the only technical person taught me:**

- **Ownership:** If it breaks, I fix it. No blaming teammates.
- **Prioritization:** Can't do everything, must choose wisely.
- **Documentation:** Future-me needs to understand today's decisions.
- **Automated testing:** No QA team means I ship my own bugs.

**But also:**

- **Loneliness:** No one to brainstorm with.
- **Decision fatigue:** Every technical choice is mine alone.
- **Burnout risk:** No backup when you're sick.

**Current realization:** After 4 years solo, I'm ready for a team. Collaboration sounds exciting again.

### Lesson #2: StackOverflow Made Me Better

**Top 3% contributor (14,111 reputation).** Not because I'm smarter than others, but because:

**Teaching forces clarity.**

When you answer someone's question, you can't hand-wave. You must:

- Understand the problem deeply
- Explain it simply
- Provide working code
- Anticipate edge cases

**Result:** Answering 694 questions made me a better engineer than reading 1,000 tutorials.

### Lesson #3: Metrics Drive Decisions

**Everything I've built has numbers attached:**

- 184% traffic growth
- 60% load time reduction
- 85-90% cache hit rate
- 99.9% uptime

**Why?** Because "I improved performance" means nothing. But "I reduced load time by 60%" is quantifiable. Measurable. Provable.

**In interviews, in promotions, in salary negotiations—numbers win.**

### Lesson #4: Technology Choices Are Bets, Not Marriages

**Bad mindset:** "I'm a PHP developer."  
**Good mindset:** "I solve problems. Currently using PHP."

**Outcome:**

- When PHP wasn't cutting it → Learned Node.js
- When jQuery got tedious → Switched to React
- When servers were expensive → Moved to serverless

**Career advice:** Fall in love with problems, not tools.

### Lesson #5: Side Interests Make You More Interesting

**Plot twist:** I teach Vedic astrology on weekends.

**Wait, what?**

Yes. When I'm not optimizing Next.js builds or configuring Kubernetes, I teach systematic astrological chart reading.

**Why mention this?**

Because it's taught me:

- **Pattern recognition** (useful in debugging)
- **Systematic thinking** (useful in architecture design)
- **Teaching skills** (useful in code reviews)
- **Humility** (there's always more to learn)

**Plus:** In technical interviews, everyone has Next.js on their resume. Not everyone teaches ancient astronomy systems.

**Life lesson:** Your quirks make you memorable. Don't hide them.

## The Hard Truths (Things I Wish Someone Told 20-Year-Old Me)

### 1. Impostor Syndrome Never Fully Goes Away

**18 years in, Top 3% StackOverflow, scaled platforms to millions of users.**

**And still:** Every time I join a new codebase, there's a voice saying _"Everyone here is smarter than you."_

**Truth:** That voice lies. But also, it keeps you humble. Double-edged sword.

### 2. Your First Job's Technology Doesn't Define Your Career

**Started with Visual Basic 6.0 in 2006.** If I'd believed "I'm a VB developer forever," I'd be unemployable by 2015.

**The industry moves fast.** Your first tech stack is training wheels. Learn the bike, then let go.

### 3. Salary Negotiations Get Easier With Proof

**Early career:** "I'm worth RM X because... I need it?"  
**Mid career:** "I'm worth RM X because I scaled Y to Z users with A% improvement."

**Data wins.** Build portfolio evidence, not just years of experience.

### 4. Corporate Politics Exist Everywhere

**Wish it weren't true.** But even in tech-first companies, politics happen.

**My approach:** Stay brutally honest, do great work, document everything.

**Result:** Mixed. Honesty sometimes costs you. But sleeping well at night is priceless.

### 5. Work-Life Balance Is Real (I Learned This Late)

**20s:** Worked 80-hour weeks. Thought sleep was for the weak.  
**30s:** Burnout. Health issues. Realized I'm not a machine.  
**40s:** Work smart, not just hard. Sustainable pace beats sprints.

**Current philosophy:** 40-hour productive weeks > 80-hour exhausted weeks.

## What I'd Tell 20-Year-Old Mohit

### Learn TypeScript Earlier

**Seriously.** I added TypeScript to FMT in 2024. Should've been 2020.

**Why it matters:** Type safety catches 70% of bugs before production. Time saved debugging > time spent writing types.

### Start Writing Technical Blogs Sooner

**Regret:** I waited until 2025 to start blogging consistently.

**Lost opportunity:** 15 years of experience could've been 100+ blog posts, establishing thought leadership.

**Advice:** Document your learning journey. Your "today obvious" is someone's "tomorrow revelation."

### Contribute to Open Source More

**StackOverflow is great.** But OSS contributions show:

- You can work in teams
- You understand large codebases
- You write production-quality code

**Current plan:** Start contributing to Next.js, Kubernetes docs, or React ecosystem.

### Build a Portfolio From Day One

**Reality:** My portfolio went live in 2024. Should've started in 2010.

**Why?** GitHub stars and testimonials compound over time.

**Lesson:** Your work has value. Showcase it.

### Ask for Help Earlier

**Stubborn truth:** I always try to solve everything alone first.

**Result:** Wasted weeks on problems that someone else solved in 10 minutes.

**New approach:** Google for 30 minutes. If stuck, ask in Slack/Discord/StackOverflow. Ego isn't worth the time loss.

## Final Thoughts: The 18-Year Meta-Lesson

**Here's what 18 years taught me that no bootcamp or tutorial ever could:**

### Technology is just the tool. Problem-solving is the craft.

- Visual Basic → PHP → React → Next.js
- All just tools
- The craft is understanding:
  - What problem needs solving?
  - Who experiences this problem?
  - What's the simplest solution?
  - How do we measure success?

### Your career is a marathon, not a sprint.

- Sprint: Work 80 hours/week for 2 years, burn out
- Marathon: Work sustainable pace for 18 years, still going strong

### Keep learning, or become obsolete.

- The technology you know today will be legacy in 5 years
- The fundamentals you learn today are forever
- Balance both

### Document everything.

- Your future self will thank you
- Your teammates will thank you
- Your interviewers will thank you
- Your blog readers will thank you

### Find what makes you excited to open your laptop.

**For me:** Watching traffic grow with each news story.

**For you:** Could be anything. Find it. Double down on it.

## Thank You, Gwalior 2000

That 64% in my 12th board exam was the first proof that I could solve hard problems.

**18 years later, I'm still proving it.**

- To myself
- To my employers
- To my users (8.5M of them)
- To anyone who doubted that a kid from Gwalior could scale platforms and compete globally

**The technologies changed.**

Visual Basic → PHP → React → Next.js → Kubernetes → ?

**The fundamentals didn't.**

Problem-solving. Continuous learning. Bias to action. Metrics-driven decisions. Brutal honesty.

**And the journey continues.**

At 40, I'm learning Android development. Not because I need to. Because I can. Because learning is what keeps you alive in this industry.

**Here's to the next 18 years.**
